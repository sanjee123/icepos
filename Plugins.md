This tutorial show to you how to work with plugins and write your own plugin.

Plugins is special java archives which is located in /plugins/ folder. Plugins can react to any events which is generated by IcePOS core system or any other plugin. To handle event you must add listener which was listen to events. This can be handled by using Core class function **addEventListener**.

Common:
**core.addEventListener(eventName, methodName)** – adds listener for specified event.

Use:
we want to print fiscal receipt after cashier is click on “Payment” button. We use event “onCheckDone”.
```
public class FiscalPrinter implements IcePlugin {

    public void printReceipt(Receipt r) {
        for (int i = 0; i < r.lines.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(r.lines[i]);
        }
    }
    
    public FiscalPrinter() throws Exception {
        Core.addEventListener("onReceiptDone", "printReceipt");
    }
    
}
```
